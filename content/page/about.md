### my history

I've been programming since the age of thirteen. Since then I have taken several AP programming classes and have participated in the Jackson Area Career Center's CIT: Programming. This class gave me the work experience and time to explore different avenues such as Web Development, Software Development, and Data Analysis. Currently I am located in Grand Rapids and plan to attend Davenport University this fall to attain my Bachelor's in Computer Science part time while hoping to begin an entry level software development job.
