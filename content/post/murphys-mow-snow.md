Business site for Murphy's Mow & Snow

<!--more-->


I was approached to make this site by my Jackson Area Career Center instructor Mr. Nelson. After getting in contact with Brent, the owner we discussed pricing and the details of what he wanted in the site.

This static site was made using Hugo, Bootstrap 4, Sass, Javascript, and of course HTML5
