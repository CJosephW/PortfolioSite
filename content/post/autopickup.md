# Auto Pickup Python Script

I wrote this script early into my time at Klavon's Pizzeria in Vandercook. Hotschedules is a scheduling app that Klavon's used for it's workers, I often felt the need to pickup more shifts and wanted a way to notify myself, and be able to decide if I wanted the shift instead of HotSchedules AutoPickup function which would just throw you into any shift on a given day.
