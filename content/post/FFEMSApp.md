# Background for App:

#### *in progress*

Fire fighters in training have a set amount of "skills" they have to learn these are proctored tasks that they must complete to finish their training. The Firefighting Career Center teacher, Mr. Morrin talked to me about the insane amount of paperwork that he has to sort through and go through every year. He asked me to find a way to fill out these PDFs for him and store them in a database.

This React Native App gets the required fields from the .docx files and puts them into React Native fields. The backend uses Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. I will attatch the backend as well as the python script used to POST the fields to the database below.
